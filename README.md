# Entertainment Genre Trend Forecasting

Predicting the peak and decline of entertainment genres using multi-platform streaming data.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and forecast trends of entertainment genres across multiple streaming platforms. By merging data from different sources,
the model predicts which genres will peak and decline over time, helping content creators and platforms make data-driven decisions.

Key points:  
- Merged data from 4 major streaming platforms  
- Conducted time series analysis on top-count genres  
- Built univariate forecasting models due to data limitations  
- Focused on actionable insights for genre popularity trends

## Datasets of different streaming platforms
